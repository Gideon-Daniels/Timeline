        <p>
          I was not born alone . I was not born first . I am not the oldest . I
          am part of another person whom I call my twin brother .

        <h2>"First Day Of School"</h2>
        <p>
          The first day of school was one of the scariest day of my life , being
          placed in a room filled with a bunch of cry babies is frightning .

        <h1>2010</h1>
        <h2>"First day of High School"</h2>
        <p>
          The day I knew I was meant for greatness was the day I was accepted at
          one of the best high schools in my area . I later found out it takes
          more than just being accepted to qualify for greatness.

        <h1>2021</h1>
        <h2>"Even In Great Attempts It Is Glorious To Fail".</h2>
        <p>
          I have struggled and suffered but it was all worthed . I found myself
          in a position of clarity . Greatness is but one though away and it
          takes determination to do it full heartedly
